title: Hello World


I have tested a lot of different blog software.
But just like with mail-clients: every single one sucks. :)

Some month ago I finally found one that sucks considerably less than anything else I tested: blogofile.
Unfortunately I really didn't want to spend any time making a proper template to get started, so I let it rot on my webserver.
Now I finally had some time and muse to finally get it done, and there it is.

The layout is probably unfinished and will receive changes, but it's good enough to get started.

I will try to get stuff to my projects and everything else posted here from now on.
