title: Flashrom support for AMD SP5100?
---

I recently bought a very neat little Supermicro mainboard, with AMD's Socket C32 and a SP5100 chipset.

I did so because it is neat hardware, I needed to replace my home-server - and mainly because it is supported by [Coreboot](http://www.coreboot.org/).
Unfortunately, it turns out that there is no version with a socketed BIOS chip out there (and resoldering a SOIC16 socket isn't easy) despite some pictures showing it.
Even more unfortunate was that it turned out that [flashrom](http://www.flashrom.org) didn't support flashing the board either.

The reason for this is, that AMD's Soutbridge 700 series makes noise on the SPI bus with its IMC (Integrated Microcontroller), so you can't safely flash because data gets corrupted.


Luckily AMD has recently released a new version of the SB700/SP5100 [register datasheet](http://support.amd.com/us/Embedded_TechDocs/44413.pdf) that documents how to turn the IMC off, and Frederic Temporelli has already added support which is waiting for inclusion in flashroms inbox: [1/2][1] and [2/2][2].

I haven't tried it out yet, but I'll do so in the next couple of days.
