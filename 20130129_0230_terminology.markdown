title: Terminology, Enlightenments fancy new terminal emulator
---

Some of you might still know or even use Eterm, a neat terminal emulator that came back when e16 was still new.
A long time there has been nothing new in this area, but Raster apparently found the muse to write another one, based on the Enlightenment Foundation Libraries.

Anyway, I don't need to tell you why you should use it, let me just show you :)

The first one shows a some weeks old version with the basic cool features:

 <source src="http://videos.gstaedtner.net/linux/terminology_overview.webm" type="video/webm" />
 Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

The second video shows the new tcat (which within some hours has been renamed to tycat due to a naming conflict) tool to make more practical use of the features:
<video width="100%" controls="controls">
 <source src="http://videos.gstaedtner.net/linux/terminology_tcat.webm" type="video/webm" />
 Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

More cool things will certainly come (some I didn't showcase are already there).

Now for the bad news, and the actual reason I wrote this post (the videos I had lying around anyway):
Only terminology 0.2 has been release so far and a lot of features are broken in this one and have been fixed since. The new versions from SVN only run on EFL 1.8 though, which will not be released for some months.

So for you to build it anyway, here's a Quick'n'Dirty patch. The tiling/split-screen feature will still be broken (it needs Elementary 1.8), however all other cool features which don't work in 0.2 work now and also on 1.7 with the patch:
