title: script to play a random series episode


I love to watch TV shows, and often have them running at random
in the background. Thus for some shows (like Futurama, Family Guy,
Mitchel and Webb...), I don't really care about which specific episode
is running.

Because picking one at random manually is a) stupid and b) boring,
I used to use a simple, but really horrible, shell one-liner to pick one.
Now I finally decided to replace it by a more flexible and much much nicer
implementation, written as a simple zsh shellscript. It uses only zsh magic
and no other tools.

Maybe someone else finds it useful, for details see the short description
in the script, it's really trivial and works very well.
